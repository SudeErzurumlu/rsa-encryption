# RSA Encryption

## Description
This project implements the RSA encryption algorithm, a widely used public-key cryptosystem for secure communication. It involves generating public and private keys, and using them to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Features
- Key generation (public & private)
- Encryption & decryption of messages
- Implementation in Python

## Usage
1. Generate RSA keys (public and private).
2. Encrypt a message using the public key.
3. Decrypt the message using the private key.
